Next Updates:
Software
- Add i2C gyro
- Get OLED working

Hardware
- Better battery holder
- Cover wires

Electronics:

Teaching:
- Print parts



Review code to remove numbers


Review code looking for blocks of code that can be placed into a small function
Review each function to see if it can be uses for all 4 drive wheels


ToDo:
x - Update wheel rotation motor speed control to access -254 (Reverse) to 254 (forward)

x - Add descriptions to  each function

x - Update variables with names for specific wheels

x - Update function notes on joystick position

Get rotary control working (Not sure how to use it to drive robot)

Add code using motor encoder to drive specific distance.

===========================

High Level tasks:
1) Determine what functions to add to code for single wheel robot
2) 



Capabilities of Single Wheel robot.
1) Joystick - Lateral movement changes the heading of the wheel
2) Joystick - longitudinal movement drives the robot forward and backward
3) Pressing joystick button homes wheel.



Capabilities on 4 wheel swerve:

1) Drive in the direction of the wheels. 
   - All wheels the same heading. 
   - Wheels spin same speed.
   - Robot heading stays fixed while robot drives

2) Rotate in a single spot. 
    - Wheels turn to 45 degree position (Opposites: +45 or -45) 
    - Wheels spin in opposite directions.
    - Robot heading changes but position does not change.

3) Turn while moving
    - Complex
